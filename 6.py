# Mutable
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[3] = 10

# I can change the "value" of the number (in that case 3rd number) it won't compromise my code: no error.

print(numbers)

# Immutable

text = "Hello world !"
text[0] = 'H'

# In case I want to change anything afterwards in "Hello world !", it will result in an error
